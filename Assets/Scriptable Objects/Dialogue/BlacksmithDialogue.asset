  - Hi there friend, I'm dealing with a BIG problem here!
  - Would you care to help me out?
  - I've sprained my wrists and can't deal with the customers myself.
  - Would help them for me?
  - All you have to do is take on their requests and create the proper YAML for their
    shield design.
  - Thanks a bunch, goodluck!
