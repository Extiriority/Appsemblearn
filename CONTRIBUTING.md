# Welcome to our contributing guide
---
Currently this project is being developed by FHICT GDT students, but perhaps in the near future others would like to contribute.
This page will give you an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue to merging you changes.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the README. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

## Getting started

### Issues
#### Create a new issue

If you find an issue with the repository or have a feature request, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Extiriority/Industry-Project-9/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
